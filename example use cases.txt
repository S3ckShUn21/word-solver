- unknown chars should be marked with either '?' or '_' or '.'

- Words should be displayed in a nice table

- There should be nice grep like character highlighting


                                Use Cases
======================================================================================

* I want to find an anagram of the given letters
    -> Search for any word with these exact number of letters in there

* I want to find an anagram of the given letters PLUS a certain number of randomness
    -> e.x. I have "abc" and I know there are 2 more unknown values "??"
    -> This would be the string "abc??"

* I know the position of certain letters and have no idea what the other spaces are
    -> e.x. The word IS "hello" and I know 'e' and 'o'
    -> This would be the string "?e??o"

* I know 0 or more characters in the string, and I know that certain characters are different than others
    -> e.x. I have a substitution cipher and I'm given "rtyyo"
    -> I know 'r' => 'h' and 't' => 'e', but I don't know the others, I just know I have a double and then single of something different
    -> This would be the string "he112" which would differentiate between the two character groups
    -> Knowing 0 of the letters, the string would be "12334"







                            How to make the anagram solver
===========================================================================================

* The word needs to have the given characters in it
* The word should have [0-n] of a specific character from the given input string

* How to make sure a given letter is within a given word in regex?
    -> "*z\w*" will return all words that contain AN 'z'

* How to make sure a set of characters is contained within a given word
    -> (?=\w*t)(?=\w*l)(?=\w*p)\w+
    -> Where 't', 'l', 'p' are the set of characters

* how to make sure a word has n of a given letter in it, in ANY position
    -> (?=(?:\w*t\w*){3})\w+
    -> Where I want exactly 3 't's in the given word

* Search for a word of set length, that contains n of a given character
    -> ^ (?=\w{12}$) (?=(?:\w*l){5}).*
    -> Where the given char is 'l' (5 repetitions) and the length of the word is 12

* If I want an anagram of the word angel
    -> I need a 5 letter word
    -> I need it to contain ONE of each of the letters in angel
    -> ^(?=\w{5}$)(?=(?:\w*a){1})(?=(?:\w*n){1})(?=(?:\w*g){1})(?=(?:\w*e){1})(?=(?:\w*l){1}).*

* Now, given there is a couple letters i know, but I don't know the whole word
    -> The example word is "soliloquy"
    -> The example mask I have is "s_l_l____"
    -> The length is 9
    -> ^s.l.l....$

* What if I know it should contain 2 l's and an s but I don't know where they go
